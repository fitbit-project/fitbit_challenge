First off, thank you for considering contributing to the `fitbit-project`! It's people like you that make this project great.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project.

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check the existing [issues](https://github.com/fitbit-project/fitbit_challenge/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible by filling out the [bug report template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature, please first check the existing [issues](https://github.com/fitbit-project/fitbit_challenge/issues) to see if a similar proposal exists. If not, create a new issue using the [feature request template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the project? You can start by looking through `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:
- **Good First Issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help Wanted** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

## Pull Request Process

We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your forked repo to your local machine.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`). The branch name should be descriptive.
4.  **Make your changes** and add them (`git add .`).
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear, descriptive commit message (`git commit -m "Feat: Add awesome new feature"`).
6.  **Push** your branch to your forked repo on GitHub (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
7.  **Open a Pull Request** from your forked repo's branch to our `main` branch.
8.  Ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable (e.g., `Fixes #34`).

## Development Setup

Ready to start coding? Here's how to get the project set up locally.

1.  Fork and clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies. (e.g., `npm install`)
3.  Run the development server. (e.g., `docker-compose up --build`)

## Styleguides

Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding style. We use linters and formatters (like ESLint or Prettier) to maintain code quality. Run the linter before submitting your PR to catch any issues.

We look forward to your contributions!
